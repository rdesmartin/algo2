You are free to choose the dataset within the following constraints :
* utf-8 encoded in a `data.csv` file
* several hundreds of lines
* at least 6 attributes (columns), the first being a unique id, separated by commas
* you may use some categorical (non quantitative) features.
* some fields should be correlated
If necessary, you can tweak a dataset in order to artificially make it possible to
apply analysis ans visualization techniques.

The file analysis.py presents a quick analysis of the dataset. For instance :
* Histograms of quantitative variables with a comment on important statistical aspects, such as means , standard deviations , etc.
* A study of potential outliers
* Correlation matrices (maybe not for all variables)
* Any interesting analysis : if you have categorical data, with categories are represented most ? To what extent ?
